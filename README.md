# Payment and Order Service

This project is a demonstration of the use of the `@Transactional` annotation in Spring Boot applications. The `@Transactional` annotation is a key feature of Spring, providing declarative transaction management capabilities.

## About

The project is a simple order management system, where orders can be placed and payments can be made. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the use of the `@Transactional` annotation, which ensures that the operations of placing an order and making a payment are atomic, i.e., they either both succeed or both fail, maintaining the integrity of the system.
